![](docs/sitemap.png)

Each page was accesibility to the other through links and also a hamburger menu in the top right corner. 

![](docs/accessibility.png)

HTML semantics were used for accesibility to ensure that individuals using a screen reader would be able to easily navigate the page by semantic sections. 

![](docs/SRI.png)

An SRI was produced to protect the integrity of the .css page on each HTML document. 

![](docs/mediaquery.png)

Media queries were added for different size devices for responsiveness. 

![](docs/mixin.png)

Mixins and also variables for colors, styles, and fonts were used to ensure that the document was concise and clear. Also, in-line comments were made (particularly on the .scss sheet) to ensure clarity for any who might use the sheet in the future, including it's author. 

![](docs/hover.png)

Different compoent features were used including responsive items that changed with :hover. These included opacity changes and translation (linear and rotational). 

![](docs/hamburger.png)

A hamburger icon with a drop down menu was used on each page for the viewer to have another means of navigation on the site. 

![](docs/resumelink.png)

A link to the author's resume was incorporated for future prospective employers. 

![](docs/footer.png)

A footer (and also nav bar) were created that could be used on various pages which help avoid redundancy. 

TECH STACK: Tech stack consisted of 9 HTML file pages, which included 4 main pages and 5 blog post pages. These were all intercontected through anchor links that made it easily accesible from one site to the other. All sites were styled by a single style.css sheet for continuity. This file was produced from a .scss sheet. 

Three different branches were made (which can be viewable on the Github platform) that each have a working branch and show a different working style. One included incorporating a green theme, instead of orange. The other was a change in font to a serif text.
